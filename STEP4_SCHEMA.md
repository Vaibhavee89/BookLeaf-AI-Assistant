# Step 4: Create Database Tables (2 minutes)

## 📍 YOU ARE HERE

Now we'll create all 8 database tables for the BookLeaf AI Assistant.

## What to do NOW:

### 1. Still in SQL Editor, click "+ New query" again
- Same place as before (top right)

### 2. I'll give you the schema file to paste
- The file is at: `database/schema.sql`
- It's about 250 lines of SQL
- You need to copy ALL of it

### 3. Paste the entire schema
- After copying, paste it into the SQL Editor
- It should fill the entire editor window

### 4. Click "RUN"
- This will take ~10-15 seconds
- You'll see multiple success messages

### 5. Verify success
- You should see green checkmarks or "Success" messages
- Multiple lines will appear showing table creation

---

## ✅ When done, tell me: "schema complete"

## 🆘 Issues?

**SQL takes long time?**
- 10-15 seconds is normal
- Don't interrupt it

**See error messages?**
- Tell me the error
- We can fix it

**Not sure if it worked?**
- If you see "Success" or green checks, it worked
- Next step will verify the tables
