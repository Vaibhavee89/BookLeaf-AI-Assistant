# Step 6: Get API Keys

## 📍 YOU ARE HERE - Final Supabase Step!

Now we need to copy 3 API keys from Supabase to configure the backend.

## What to do NOW:

### 1. Click "Settings" in left sidebar
- Look at the BOTTOM of the left sidebar
- Find the gear icon ⚙️
- Text says "Settings"
- **CLICK IT**

### 2. Click "API" in the settings menu
- After clicking Settings, you'll see a submenu
- Click **"API"**

### 3. You'll see two sections - copy 3 keys:

---

## KEY #1: Project URL

Look for section: **"Config"** or **"Project URL"**

You'll see a URL like: `https://xxxxxxxxxxxxx.supabase.co`

- Click the COPY icon next to it
- **SAVE THIS** (paste in a note)

---

## KEY #2: Anon Key (Public Key)

Scroll down to: **"Project API keys"**

Find the key labeled: **"anon"** or **"public"**

- It's a long string starting with `eyJ...`
- Click the COPY icon
- **SAVE THIS** (paste in a note)

---

## KEY #3: Service Role Key (Secret Key)

In the same **"Project API keys"** section:

Find: **"service_role"**

- Click **"Reveal"** to show it
- It's also a long string starting with `eyJ...`
- Click the COPY icon
- **SAVE THIS** (paste in a note)
- ⚠️ **KEEP THIS SECRET!**

## ✅ When you have all 3 keys saved, tell me:

"I have all 3 keys"

OR just paste them here (one per line) like:

```
URL: https://xxxxxxxxxxxxx.supabase.co
ANON: eyJhbGc...
SERVICE: eyJhbGc...
```

I'll configure everything for you automatically!
