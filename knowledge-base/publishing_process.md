# BookLeaf Publishing Process

## Overview

At BookLeaf Publishing, we've streamlined the publishing journey to make it as simple and transparent as possible for our authors. From manuscript submission to your book appearing on shelves (physical and digital), we guide you through every step of the process.

## Submission Process

### Initial Manuscript Submission

To submit your manuscript to BookLeaf Publishing:

1. **Create an Account**: Sign up on our author portal at bookleaf.com/authors
2. **Prepare Your Manuscript**: Ensure your manuscript is in one of our accepted formats (DOCX, PDF, or EPUB)
3. **Submit Online**: Upload your manuscript through your author dashboard
4. **Provide Metadata**: Include genre, target audience, word count, and a brief synopsis
5. **Include Supporting Materials**: Cover letter, author bio, and marketing plan (optional)

**Timeline**: You'll receive an automated confirmation immediately, and our team will review your submission within 5-7 business days.

### Review and Evaluation

Our editorial team carefully reviews each submission:

- **Initial Screening** (5-7 days): We check if your manuscript meets our basic criteria and aligns with our publishing categories
- **Editorial Review** (2-3 weeks): If approved for full review, an editor reads your complete manuscript
- **Decision** (3-4 weeks total): We'll notify you of our publishing decision via email and in your author dashboard

If accepted, you'll receive a publishing agreement outlining terms, timelines, and mutual responsibilities.

## Editorial Process

### Manuscript Editing

Once your manuscript is accepted:

1. **Developmental Editing** (4-6 weeks): Major structural edits, plot consistency, character development
2. **Line Editing** (3-4 weeks): Sentence-level refinement, style, voice, and clarity
3. **Copy Editing** (2-3 weeks): Grammar, punctuation, spelling, and consistency
4. **Proofreading** (1-2 weeks): Final check before publication

**Author Involvement**: You'll review and approve changes at each stage. We use tracked changes in Word documents for easy collaboration.

### Cover Design and Formatting

Parallel to editing, our design team works on your book:

- **Cover Design**: Our designers create 2-3 cover concepts based on your input and market research
- **Interior Formatting**: Professional layout for both print and digital versions
