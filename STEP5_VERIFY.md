# Step 5: Verify Tables

## 📍 YOU ARE HERE - Almost done with Supabase!

Let's verify all 8 tables were created successfully.

## What to do NOW:

### 1. Click "Table Editor" in left sidebar
- Look for icon that looks like a grid/table
- Or text that says "Table Editor"
- **CLICK IT**

### 2. Check for 8 tables
You should see these tables listed on the LEFT side:
- ✅ authors
- ✅ conversations
- ✅ escalations
- ✅ identities
- ✅ knowledge_documents
- ✅ knowledge_embeddings
- ✅ messages
- ✅ query_analytics

### 3. Count them
- You should see exactly **8 tables**
- They might be in alphabetical order

---

## ✅ If you see all 8 tables, tell me: "8 tables confirmed"

## 🆘 If you see fewer tables:
- Tell me how many you see
- List which ones are missing
- We can re-run specific parts
