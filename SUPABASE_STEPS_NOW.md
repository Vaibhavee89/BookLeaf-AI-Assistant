4. **Click "Create new project"**

   - Be patient - this is normal!
   - DON'T refresh the page

## ⏰ After Project is Created (2-3 min wait)

You'll see your project dashboard with:
- Project name at top
- Left sidebar with options like "Table Editor", "SQL Editor", etc.

**When you see this, tell me: "Project is ready"**

---

## 🆘 Issues?

**Don't see "New project" button?**
- Try refreshing the page
- Look for "All projects" or "Home" in sidebar
- You might need to create an organization first

**Organization creation confusing?**
- It's just a way to group projects
- Name it anything: "My Projects", "BookLeaf", etc.
- Click "Create organization" first, then "New project"

**Password tips:**
- Use at least 12 characters
- Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- Example: `BookLeaf2024!Secure#Pass`
- **SAVE IT SOMEWHERE SAFE!**
